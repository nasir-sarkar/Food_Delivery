# Title
Khuda Lagche - A Food Delivery Management System

# Quick Look
Khuda Lagche is a basic food ordering system developed in Java with a graphical user interface (GUI) using Java Swing. The system supports two types of users: Admin and Normal Users. Users must register before logging in, while Admins can log in directly.

The application allows users to browse menus, select food items for Breakfast, Lunch, or Dinner, place orders, and complete payments online. Admins have privileges to manage user accounts, including adding new users, viewing all registered users, and deleting accounts.
